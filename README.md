## C Program â€“ Control Flow

This repository contains GeeksforGeeks C Programming Examples (Control Flow). This is next part of my repository C_Program_Basic.
If you just started learning C Programming, then Checking out my repository C_Program_Basic before this, would be best.

Control flow refer to executing the order of statements. They mainly are used for making decisions, repeat and jump  to specific sections of code. 

In C Programing :
 * Conditional Statements
 * Looping Statements
 * Control Transfer Statements

## Conditional Statements


1. if statement : -
 if statement lets us test for a condition (such as comparing two variables)
and execute different parts of code, depending on the conditions with
relational and logical operators are also included.


2. if-else statement : - 
Sometimes we need one bloock of code to be true and other block to be false. if works on the condition.

3. else-if statement : - 
To execute 2 or more condetions one after other if their true or not, else-if statement is used.

4. Nested-if statement : -
Executing an if statement inside another if staement. This refers to a condition being checked after the outer if is true.
 
5. Switch statement : -
Based on the results of a specific expression we may want different outputs. Switch allows us to do that. for different cases we can get recuired results.


## Looping Statements

1. for loop : -
This allows us to repeat the execution of a block of code for a fix number. It follows initialization, the condition, and the update.

2. while loop : -
This repeats a block of code until it reaches certain condition.

3. do-while loop : -
This runs a block of code then for specific condition it repeats. It will run the code at eat once. Based on the conditon it repeats.

## Control Transfer Statements
